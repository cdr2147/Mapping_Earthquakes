# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The Disaster Reporting Network has requested that you create interactive maps that visualize earthquake data from around the world.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. To complete this project, we use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days before adding the data to the map.

### Tools
* JavaScript
* D3.js library
* Leaflet library
* Mapbox map

## Summary
Using these tools, we create an interactve map with earthquake data from the past 7 days with 3 map styles and 3 map layers. The 3 map layers show all earthquakes, tectonic plate lines, and major earthquakes (above 4.5 magnitude) in the last 7 days.

## Results
The map can be easily adjusted to hone in on specific earthquake data from the last 7 days. Additional layers and map styles could be added to capture more information.
